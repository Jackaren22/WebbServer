        I want Zac's big dong to dingelidong andreas from the behind so he can take the helicopter ride tomorrow and eat some of that spicy cake made by the one and only gabbepro007, he has gotten way better at making those spicy cakes and i would really love to eat them you know. He might also have some bananas to confiscate and put in the library to show the evil demon lord from another world who is the best at making pancakes. If that cause would happen then the world would crumble before all of our eyes and all hope would be lost. To make sure that is not the case we will ensure that the power of shrek will defeat the lizard before it lays eggs. But the only way to do that is to get reincarnated into another world and get a harem with super op powers to earn loads of money to bribe the lizard with. Once the lizard has been defeated we can start working on collecting the hidden treasures of yaman. There are 256 in total and if all are collected you have the power to controll everyones sexuallity. With this power and gabbepros cakes the universe would be simple to control and therefor activate the stargate so we can enter the star realm of lolis. There we will encounter a lot of lolis. A lot. So you must gather up a lot of courage before you enter this land because you might question yourself later on but just remember that you did it for the sake of humanity. The police is constantly controlling the area so we must be very very careful on how we approach this. But back to the main point, we need gabbes cake to be able to even start this journey so it's time to go forth and conquer land.

                <br><br>
            It all starts of with Andreas "Leffe, Anders, Bengt, Anden, Bröd, Steffe" Osån. He was on the way to the former toxicity god himselfs house mr Tranzite to get teached the way of reformation. The reason Andreas had to meet mr Tranzite is because he had started to tilt 20 degrees constantly and needed to learn the ways of reformation so he could have a normal stable life again. But of course, life isn't that simple sometimes, when he was on the highway with his honorable pig Kebab he got assaulted by mr Zac and he was ready with his big dong. Anders had to dodge but in other to do so unfortunately kebab had to fucking die. Anders was very sad about kebabs death, so sad that he fell on the floor and started crying. Zac just stood in silence and re though his actions in life and reflected on what he just had done, he killed Kebab. Lightning struck besides him and Zac had never been more scared in his life, it was a wallah bror. He had come with the thunder and he was ready to eliminate all who killed pigs, and Zac was now a pig killer and would now have to face his wrath. Zac took forth his might big dong again to prepare his defense but it was to late. The wallah bror had already struck a clean strike with his supreme sword straight through Zac left arm and it was torn apart in a matter of split seconds and flew away at a ridiculous speeds. It took awhile for Zac to realise what had just happened but when he did the scream he let out could not have been more devastating. <b>"-Kyaaaaaa~~".</b> the wallah bro was filled with dread in an instant and figured out just from the scream what type of human Zac was. He was a masochist. Zacs big dong just got powered up 99 times and within a second the fight was over, the wallah bror was gone, reduced to atoms. Now that he had gotten his power up he had no use of Anders anymore and so he just left the area within a flash. Anders, who was still in shock could not grasp what just had happened in front of him. Not only was his trusty Kebab dead, a wallah bro just disappeared in an instant after the big dong had hit him. But then it hit him. "-Mr Tranzite!". He might have the answers he was looking for. He forced his body to stand up and continued the way towards his house, it wasn't a long way left but without his pig it could still take a while. After a tedious 15 min walk he was finally there, mr Tranzites house. Anders walked up to the front porch and quickly started banging on the door. After banging for a few seconds Anders heard someone inside start talking about liberals and the voice got closer and close and then... BOOM. the door got flung open right in Anders face and he flew backwards. "-fooking liberal get of my lawn", said the man that had opened the door, and it was no other then mr Tranzite the reformed toxic god. Anders got quickly back on his feet and told everything that had happened to him to Tranzite. "-I see, the Zac has been freed that is quite concerning". "Come inside, there is something i must show you". Mr Tranzite lets Anders into is house and leads him into the kitchen. He slowly opens his fridge and Anders could not believe his eyes. Bacon. he had bacon in his fridge, he had just witnessed his pig die in front of him and now this!? mr Tranzite then took out a piece of bacon and put in his mouth. Anders couldn't hold in his rage anymore, he dashed towards Tranzite and tried to punch his face but Tranzite easily dodges and hits a perfect counterpunch into his stomach. "-Don't tell me you are vegan.." said Tranzite after he had proceeded to get Anders on the ground helpless. It was true, Anders was a vegan. Ever since he was dropped as a child he could not help himself being a beta cuck vegan. But that wasn't his fault, if only his parents wouldn't have been so careless he might have not turned out this way. "-I will teach you how to reform so you can leave your pathetic self behind and become a man, a man capable of stopping Zac".

        <b>Chapter 2</b><br>  Spicy Pancakes <br> <br> The training started right away because there was no time to lose, leffe stayed up day and night to hone his skills to defeat Zac. The training was tough and it took a great toll on his body. There was some sort of epic training montage but we will have to wait for the anime adaptation to see that shit. After 4 weeks Anders had gotten incredibly stronger but he still had long ways to go to surpass mr Tranzite and he was even further away of even being able to touch the Zac. <br> <br> <b>UPDATED STORY!!! :)</b> <br> <br> One morning Anders decided he was gonna train his cake making skills so he went into the kitchen and gathered up all the ingridiences. But there was something missing... The flour. He then remembered that Mr Tranzite had warned him that if something was missing in the kitchen there was only one thing to do, run. Anders started to sweat as he knew that Tranzite would never tell a lie or anything unnecessary to him. He then heard muffled sounds comming down from the basement.  "-oh fuc..." was the only words that managed to come out from Anders mouth before the basementdoor was swung open and an white like creature rushed towards him. Leffe managed to dodge the rush but the creature instantly came back for him. Thanks to Mr Tranzites training Anders could keep on side stepping the flurry of attacks that were being thrown at him without a problem. "-heh this is way too easy compared to my training" said Anders to himself whilst thinking of a way of counter attacking. That statement seemed to have angered the monster because it had suddenly caught fire and began to eject fireballs from its own body. It seems as though it had increased speed aswell because Anders got hit by multiple fireballs and was yeeted to the otherside of the kitchen. His body got peirced by the fireballs and there was now 3 holes covered in boiling blood. Anders let out a big screech as he was fucking dying because he underestimated his enemy.
